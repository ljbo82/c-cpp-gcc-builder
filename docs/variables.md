# Variable Reference

The way in which your project is built is defined according to variables defined in its `Makefile`.

When the build system is included at the end of your project's `Makefile`, it will inspect the value of defined variables (defined either in the makefiles, environment, or command-line), check the project tree, and will create targets that allows a user to build the project.

Some variables are expected to be defined exclusively on any or your project's makefiles, some of them are recommended to be defined on command line, and others are read-only (i.e. contains utility information generated by the build system and cannot be modified by the user/project).

!!! note "Validation of variables"
    The build system will check the origin and the value of each used variable, and when a violation is detected it will generate an error.

This document contain details about all variables used by the build system:

!!! note "Variable details"
    For each detailed variable, the following fields refer to:

    * **Description:** Contains descriptive information about the variable.

    * **Required:** Defines if a variable must be defined (and it must be non-empty) during build.

    * **Default value:** Contains the value which will be assumed if variable is optional and it is not defined.

    * **Mutable:** Some variables defined in makefiles can be updated by the build system. This field explain details about how such variables can be modified by the build system.

    * **Origins:** Contains the list of allowed origins for variable definition.

    * **Restrictions:** Contains information about restrictions on which kind of values that can be stored in the variable.

## Command-line variables

The following variables that can perfectly be defined inside a makefile, although is strongly recommeded that they should be defined via command-line during `make` invocation in order to achive maximum flexibility during build:

### DEBUG

* **Description:** Enables/Disables the debug mode for the build.
    * While bulding in debug mode (i.e. when `DEBUG = 1`), debug symbols will be added to generated binary artifact.
    * In release mode (i.e. when `DEBUG = 0`), Debugging symbols are, by default, [stripped](#STRIP_RELEASE) from generated binary and [compiler optimizations](#OPTIMIZE_RELEASE) will be applied during building process.
* **Required:** No
* **Default value:** `0` (i.e. release mode)
* **Mutable:** No
* **Origins:** The variable can be declared through any origin, although it is strongly recommended to define this variable through command-line parameters.
* **Restrictions:** Accepted values are **`1`** (enable debug mode) or **`0`** (disables debug mode / enables release mode).

### DIST_MARKER

* **Description:** Creates a marker file (empty file) which will touched every time the any of the the [distribution files](#dist) were changed. This is useful to create dependencies on sub-make.

* **Origins:** _Any, although it is strongly recommended to define this variable through command-line parameters._
* **Restrictions:**

    * Since this file will be placed in [`$(O)`](#O) directory, passing relative paths resulting in a directory other than [`$(O)`](#O) is not allowed (an error will be raised by the build system)

### HOST

* **Description:** Sets the target host for compilation (see [multiplatform projects](#multiplatform-projects)).
* **Required:** No
* **Default value:** _Native host identified by [native-host.mk](native-host.mk.md) or value is left undefined if native host was not detected._

  * Its value will be used to set the name of [final artifact](#ARTIFACT) if it is left undefined (on linux, osx, and windows hosts).
* **Required:** No
