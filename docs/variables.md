# Variable Reference

The way in which your project is built is defined according to variable values.

When the build system is included at the end of your project's `Makefile`, it will inspect the value of defined variables (defined either in the makefiles, environment, or command-line), check the project tree, and will create targets that allows a user to build the project.

Some variables are expected to be defined exclusively by any or your project's makefiles, some of them are recommended to be defined via command line, and others are read-only (i.e. contains utility information generated by the build system and cannot be modified by the user/project). The build system will check the origin and the value of each known variable, and when a violation is detected it will generate an error.

!!! Note
    The build system automatically includes extra [makefiles](../#makefiles), which also expect/expose their own set of variables. Check the documentation of each of them for details about expected/exposed variables.

This document contain details about all variables known by the build system.

!!! note "Variable details"
    For each detailed variable, the following fields refer to:

    * **Description:** Contains descriptive information about the variable.

    * **Required:** Defines if a variable must be defined (and it must be non-empty) during build.

    * **Default value:** Contains the value which will be assumed if variable is optional and it is not defined.

    * **Origins:** Contains the list of allowed origins for variable definition.

    * **Restrictions:** Contains information about restrictions on which kind of values that can be stored in the variable.


!!! Warning
    The build system declare internal private variables that are not intended to be used by projects. All of those private variables, have their names prefixed with `cpb_` prefix. Please avoid using/defining variables with names beginning with such prefix.

    The build system checks for usage of critical known private variables and, most of the time, any attempt to define such variables will result in an error raised by the build system.
